For our legend test, we checked the first few, a couple middle two, and the last one. 
This was done to make sure all should be loaded in. We then check that the number 
of rows and columns are right. For our door tests, we selected four doors 
that all opened in different ways. Each door opened down, up, left, or right
to make sure all of the possible doors functioned correctly. We also tested 
a walkway cell and a room cell to make sure they were not read in as doors. 
We made sure there were 13 doors as are in our excel document. Next we tested 
to make sure the first cells from a few rooms read in correctly, meaning the 
top-left most cell in a room. Finally we tested some of the last cells from some rooms.
